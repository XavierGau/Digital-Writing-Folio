### Questions

#### What tools (or techniques) do you use to write?

I use word, specifically Garamond font. The technique I use can change; sometimes i'll have loud music blasting, other times I'll need complete silence. I search for images as insperation.

#### How do these tools shape the way you write (e.g.,constrain the way you write or facilitate your writing)?

Writing on word means i am limited in the way i can interact with the audience, there is only words on a page.
