# Reflection on Digital Writing

### Introduction

Digital Writing was one of the courses I've enjoyed the most. It was a genuinely interesting topic to cover that has broadened my horizons with new skills and knowledge. I have always had a strong interest in video games, the medium in which it provides writers with the ability to interact with the audience is, in my opinion, unmatched by any other. Although video games are not the exact same as digital literature, there is a lot of overlap and the line between the two is thin. It is in this way that my passion for video games could easily transfer over to an interest in digital literature and writing.
I found this course a great way to push that passion and understand more about the industry. Through exploring the ways I can express myself creatively through this medium, I'll be able to pursue this way of writing.


### Interactive Fiction

Digital Writing taught me how to plan, develop, implement, and publish digital literature confidently and effectively. It taught me the fundamentals to take steps into the world of interactive fiction and to develop my skills further through the publishing of my own works. I found my study of *Digital: A Love Story* a great introduction to what I could achieve in the medium. The piece was simple, linear, and 12 years old, but it still achieved what no piece of written literature could and allowed the reader to engage in a completely different way. It was through my interaction with various examples of digital literature and writing my own, that I have been able to gain appreciation of the world of digital literature. The course gave me a deep insight into what it means to be considered digital literature, and what goes into writing it. My eyes have been opened to the world of writing interactive fiction and I'm excited to continue to experiment with the form. 


### Professional Development 

The industry for digital writing is growing quickly, more and more people are turning to the internet for new ways of interacting with fiction. The idea of interactive fiction is becoming more mainstream than ever before, which can be seen in the massive growth in the gaming industry and even examples such as Netflix releasing its own interaction fiction with *Black Mirror: Bandersnatch*. We, as writers, need to keep up with the on-growing demand. By introducing myself to the world of digital writing and interactive fiction through this course, I am giving myself the skills and knowledge to be able to enter the digital writing space professionally. 
Throughout the course, I have learnt how to effectively use a variety of industry standard programs, such as Twine, Inform 7, Bitsy, GitHub, Visual Studio Code and more, as well as the basics for coding languages such as HTML, CSS, and Java. I am confident that having taken this course, I now have the skills to compete in the digital writing industry.


### Conclusion

Through my time with this course, I have developed the skills, passion and knowledge to create my own industry standard digital literature. I plan to continue to drive myself towards learning more about this medium of writing and foster the interest I have for its unique form. With all the skills I have developed, I feel confident in adding this form of writing to my arsenal of tools at my disposal in the future.
