### Questions

#### What types of writing do you do?

I really enjoy all things fiction, particularly fantasy. Something about a world of unknown things where anything can happen really draws me in and is the reason I enjoy writing (and reading). Recently, I've also been enjoying poetry, although I have extremely limited experience with it. I tend to write free verse as it allows me to express my emotions and thoughts without the restrictions of rhyme and rhythm, I can focus on the beauty of the words and the emotions behind them.

#### What tools (or techniques) do you use to write?

I use word, specifically I use Garamond font until I need to hand it in, then I switch to Times New Roman. It's a small thing, but it can often help me a lot with my writing, especially if it's a creative piece. Ever since I starting taking writing somewhat seriously, I have used Garamond font. 

The technique I use can change; sometimes I'll have loud music blasting, other times I'll need complete silence or a loop of white noise (static). I've found sound has a huge impact on my ability to zone the world out and bring myself into my writing. Sometimes the world is all too loud and my brain feels foggy so I just need silence, although I'll still have headphones on to feel comfortable with what I'm used to; other times I'll have no motivation and I need the DOOM soundtrack on full-ball. It really depends, but sound is incredibly important to my ability to write.

I often search for images as inspiration for what I want to write, whether it be looking for a generic foggy night, or a screenshot from a very specific part of a game I played years ago. I often find something that I like and it will have other elements to it that I haven't thought of, which I can then introduce into my own writing.

#### How do these tools shape the way you write (e.g.,constrain the way you write or facilitate your writing)?

Writing on Word means I am limited in the way I can interact with the audience, there is only words on a page. I can aim to make the reader feel a certain way, to push them into a specific mindset, but I can not interact with them the same way a video game or piece of digital writing can. Perhaps it would be more accurate to say that 
standard fiction doesn't limit how you can interact with the reader, but instead, it limits the ways in which the reader can interact with *you*. 


## Week 2


|Title|Pros|Cons|
|-------|-------|------|
|Dwarf Fortress|Looks really fun, obviously has a lot of thought into it, enjoyable old-school ASCII look|Extremely hard to understand, no story, is more game than digital story|
|The Hunt for the Gay Planet|Humorous, gay (same), a lot of content|The story feels extremely locked, your decisions are either right or wrong, feels very padded|
|Digital: A love Story|Really cool visuals, feels like you're actually using an old PC, really nice background music, genuinely engaging story, funny references trickled throughout (such as Star Trek references), gameplay is engaging|No actual choices, the dial up system gets old after a while, a lot of guessing what to do next|
